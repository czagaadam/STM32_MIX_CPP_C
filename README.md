# STM32_MIX_CPP_C

ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This a demonstration of how to use and compile together C++ C codes and a pre-compiled objects.

The C++ part is my GPIObase class.

https://github.com/czagaadam/STM32_GPIO

C part is the components code generated by CubeMX(usart,i2c etc.)

Pre-compiled object is a library for VL53L0x distance sensor.

# VL53L0x
VL53L0x library is written in C.
The core library is the property of STM, I made some smaller modifications and the higher abstraction layer is created by me.
